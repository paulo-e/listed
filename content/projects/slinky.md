Slinky is a library for quick development in Spring Boot using Java Generics and Java Reflection. It allows users to
extend generic classes that provide them basic operations such as creating, updating, deleting and viewing entities.

[You can see how to use slinky here](../../2022/01/09/using-slinky/).

## Requisites

Although Slinky is pretty easy to use, it is recommended to understand the following fundamentals before using it:

- Java/Kotlin
- HTTP (Methods, Response Codes, etc...)
- REST/RESTful
- JSON
- Spring Boot

Slinky was made so that developers could save time and write less boilerplate, not so newer developers could skip over
fundamentals. To create a robust API, it is required for you to understand how Slinky works. At least to a basic level.
